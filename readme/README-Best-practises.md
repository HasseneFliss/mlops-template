## **Pipeline Overview**

### **Steps**
1. **Preprocessing with Dask**: Efficiently process and prepare large datasets for training.
2. **Incremental Model Training**: Train the model in chunks using Scikit-learn's `SGDRegressor`.
3. **Model Deployment with Flask**: Expose the trained model as an API for predictions.
4. **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Automate testing, training, and deployment.
5. **Scalable Deployment with Kubernetes**: Ensure high availability and scalability for the prediction service.

## **Step 1: Preprocessing with Dask**

Efficiently handle large datasets using Dask, which processes data in manageable chunks and minimizes memory usage.


### **Why Use Dask?**
- **Scalability**: Dask handles large datasets by processing them in chunks.
- **Efficiency**: It minimizes memory usage compared to pandas, which loads the entire dataset into memory.
- **Performance**: Parallel processing speeds up computations for massive datasets.
- 

### **What Happens?**
1. The dataset is read using Dask, which splits it into manageable chunks.
2. Missing values are removed to ensure clean data.
3. The data is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## **Step 2: Incremental Model Training with SGDRegressor**

### **Why Use Incremental Training?**
- **Memory Efficiency**: Loads only small chunks of data into memory, reducing resource usage.
- **Scalability**: Supports incremental learning for massive datasets, making it suitable for datasets too large to fit into memory.
- **Speed**: Processes data in chunks, avoiding the computational overhead of loading the entire dataset at once.

### **What Happens?**
1. The training data is loaded in chunks using Dask, enabling scalable data processing.
2. A `SGDRegressor` model (Stochastic Gradient Descent) is initialized for training.
3. The model is trained incrementally using the `partial_fit` method, which updates the model with each chunk of data.
4. The trained model is saved as a `.pkl` file for later use in deployment.

## **Step 3: Model Deployment with Flask**

### **Why Use Flask?**
- **Simplicity**: Flask is lightweight and easy to use, making it a great choice for serving machine learning models.
- **Deployment Ready**: Flask applications can be easily containerized and deployed using Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Integration**: The Flask app integrates seamlessly with the trained model and exposes a REST API.

### **What Happens?**
1. The trained model (`trained_model.pkl`) is loaded by the Flask application.
2. A REST API endpoint (`/predict`) is exposed to accept JSON input, process it, and return predictions.
3. Users can interact with the model via tools like Postman or programmatically using HTTP requests.

## **Step 4: CI/CD with GitHub Actions**

### **Why Use GitHub Actions?**
- **Automation**: Automates the entire pipeline, including testing, preprocessing, training, and deployment.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures every code change is processed through a consistent pipeline.
- **Integration**: GitHub Actions integrates natively with the GitHub repository and supports custom workflows.

### **What Happens?**
1. When a change is pushed to the repository, GitHub Actions triggers the pipeline.
2. Steps include:
   - Validating the dataset format.
   - Running the preprocessing script to clean and split the data.
   - Training the model incrementally on large datasets.
   - Saving the trained model as an artifact for later use.
   - Building and pushing the Docker image for deployment.
3. CI/CD ensures the entire workflow is automated and ready for deployment.

## **Step 5: Scalable Deployment with Kubernetes**

### **Why Use Kubernetes?**
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes manages multiple replicas of the API for load balancing.
- **High Availability**: Ensures the service remains available even if individual pods fail.
- **Ease of Management**: Kubernetes handles resource allocation, scaling, and traffic routing.

### **What Happens?**
1. The trained model is containerized using Docker, along with the Flask application.
2. Kubernetes manages the deployment, ensuring that the Flask application is highly available.
3. A `Service` is created in Kubernetes to expose the API to external traffic.
4. Kubernetes automatically scales the application based on demand and monitors its health.

## **Summary**
This pipeline provides a scalable, automated solution for training and deploying machine learning models on large datasets. By combining tools like Dask, Flask, GitHub Actions, and Kubernetes, it ensures efficient processing, training, and deployment while maintaining high availability and scalability.
